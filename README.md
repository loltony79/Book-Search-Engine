# Project Name: Book Search Engine

## Description
This app is a conversion from express to graphql, I would like you to know in advance that this assignment might not function fully, as there is some errors in the client pages that I can't resolve. 

## Installation 
npm run install
npm run build
npm run develop

## Usage 
We take the starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The server side is working, but the client side has errors.
